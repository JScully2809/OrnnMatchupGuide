   <h2>Items</h2>
   <p>Tank items require adapting to the enemy comp as much as possible. Always build towards the biggest threat to you and your team while matching the strength to match the enemy top laner as well. Build optimally so you're strong at all times and not delaying your build because games end quickly. Try to keep yourself and your team alive until you get objectives and start winning fights</p>
